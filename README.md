# hyf-plan

A tool to generate markdown files for planned HYF modules. These files can be pasted into GitHub as an issue.

## Usage

Install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Run the application:

```
npm start
```

## Data Management

To be detailed, but for now inspect the `data` folder, containing **markdown** and **yaml** files.
